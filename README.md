# Tries

A trie is an efficient tree-like data structure to store and retrieve information. It operates on associative data structures, primarily strings.

## Prior knowledge

- Min and max heap are complete binary trees with some unique properties. The root node has the minimum value in a min-heap, while in a max-heap, the root node has the maximum value.
- Hashset is usually used for high-performance operations involving a set of unique data. Since the hashset contains unique elements, its internal structure is optimized for faster searches.
- Hashmap stores items as key/value pairs. Values can be accessed by indexes, known as keys, of a user-defined type. 
- Depth first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It uses the idea of backtracking. It explores all the nodes by going forward if possible or uses backtracking.
- Breadth first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## Project sections

- Prefix searching: Tries are popularly known as prefix trees. They're used to solve a variety of prefix-searching and prefix-matching problems. This pattern introduced you to solving problems that involve detecting full or partial matches in strings, finding shared prefixes between multiple strings, finding or counting the number of words containing a prefix, and replacing matching words with another phrase.
- Suffix searching: This is the opposite of prefix searching. This pattern introduced you to solving problems that involve detecting full or partial matches in strings associated with the ending characters of strings, finding shared suffixes between multiple strings, counting the number of suffixes in strings, finding or counting the number of words containing a suffix, and replacing matching suffixes with another phrase.
- Pattern matching: This pattern introduced you to solving problems that involve finding a pattern in the given strings, creating abbreviations for strings, and finding similar words.
- Trie traversal: This pattern introduced you to solving problems that involve printing the contents of a trie, sorting the trie data in lexicographical order, deleting or adding some data in the existing trie data, searching for data in an existing trie, and performing some operation on trie node in a particular well-defined order.
- File systems: This pattern introduced you to solving problems that involve designing a file system, checking the existence of folders and files in a file system, and deleting duplicate files and folders in a file system.
- Search engines: This pattern introduced you to solving problems that involve designing a basic search engine with features like auto-complete, spelling autocorrection, and result ranking based on user search history.
- Miscellaneous: This pattern introduced you to solving problems that don't fit under well-defined patterns. Some examples of these are finding and counting the number of substrings, subsequences, palindromes, and anagrams, sorting alphabetical and numerical data related to prioritization, and reordering alphabetical and numerical data.
